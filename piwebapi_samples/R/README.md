The sample code in this folder demonstrates how to utilize the PI Web API in R. The sample code is dependent on:
- [Downloading R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
- [Installing httr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr) to work with HTTP and jsonlite for parsing and generating JSON

The steps below assume that you have [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Getting Started
------------

To run the sample code:
- Clone the GitHub repository
- Open RStudio  
- Install httr if not already installed.  From the Console inside RStudio ```install.packages("httr")```
- Open the file: ```sampleCode.R```
- Click the __Source__ menu option to execute the sample code  


Getting Started with Tests
------------

To run the sample tests:
- Install [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html) if not already installed.  From the Console inside RStudio ```install.packages("testthat")```
- Open the file: ```sampleCode.R```
- Search for the text __defaultPIWebAPIUrl__, add your PI Web API Url.  For example:

```R
defaultPIWebAPIUrl <- "https://mydomain.com/piwebapi"
```

- Search for the text __defaultAssetServer__, add your Asset Server Name.  For example:  

```R
defaultAssetServer <- "AssetServerName"
```

- Search for the text __defaultPIServer__, add your PI Server Name.  For example:  

```R
defaultPIServer <- "PIServerName"
```

- Search for the text __defaultName__, add your PI Web API user name.  (Not needed for kerberos)  For example:  

```R
defaultName <- "MyUserName"
```

- Search for the text __defaultPassword__, add your PI Web API user password. (Not needed for kerberos) For example:  

```R
defaultPassword <- "MyUserPassword"
```

- Search for the text __defaultAuthorization__, add your PI Web API authentication method: ```basic``` or ```gssnegotiate``` (for kerberos).    For example:  

```R
defaultAuthorization <- "basic"
```

- Open the file: ```run_tests.r```
- Search for the text path __<- "."__, change the path to the folder in which you placed the R scripts. For example: 

```R
path <- "C:\\R\\"
```

- Click the __Source__ menu option to execute the sample code tests

System Configuration
----------------------------

In order to run this sample, you must configure PI Web API with the proper security to:
- Create an AF database
- Create AF categories
- Create AF templates
- Create AF elements with attributes
- Create PI Points associated with element attributes
- Write and read element attributes
- Delete all the above AF/PI Data Archive objects  

In addition, PI Web API must be configured to allow CORS as follows:  

Attribute|Value|Type
------|------------|---
CorsExposedHeaders|Allow,Content-Encoding,Content-Length,Date,Location|String
CorsHeaders|*|String
CorsMethods|*|String
CorsOrigins|*|String
CorsSupportsCredentials|True|Boolean
DisableWrites|False|Boolean 


Functionality
------------

This sample shows basic functionality of the PI Web API, not every feature. The sample is meant to show a basic sample application that uses the PI Web API to read and write data to a PI Data Archive and AF. Tests are also included to verify that the code is functioning as expected.

The functionality included with this sample includes(recommended order of execution):
- Create an AF database
- Create a category
- Create an element template
- Create an element and associate the element's attributes with PI tags where appropriate
- Write a single value to the attribute
- Write 100 values to an attribute
- Perform a Batch (6 steps in 1 call) operation which includes:  
  - Get the sample tag  
  - Read the sample tag's snapshot value  
  - Read the sample tag's last 10 recorded values  
  - Write a value to the sample tag  
  - Write 3 values to the sample tag  
  - Read the last 10 recorded values from the sample tag only returning the value and timestamp
- Return all the values over the last 2 days
- Return timestamp and values over the last 2 days  
- Delete the element
- Delete the element template
- Delete the sample database
