# Requirements

You must complete the following tasks before running PI System Deployment Tests:

* Prepare your target PI System with required and optional PI System components.

* Set up the test client machine.

* Set access privileges for the user(s) running the tests.

* Edit the *App.config* file.

  **Note:** PI high availability (HA) setups and features are not supported by PI System Deployment Tests.

## Prepare your target PI System

The tables below list the required and optional PI System components for the target PI System.

**Note:** PI Data Link and PI SQL Client must be installed on the test client machine if you want to run
tests for either of these optional PI System components.

### Optional PI System components

If you want the test associated with an optional PI System component to run, indicate its location by assigning a value to it in the *App.config* file.  Currently, the PI System components listed below are the only components for which tests are available.

**Note:** If the value for a key is left blank ("") in the *App.config* file, the tests associated with this PI System component will not run.

### Set up the test client machine

Before running PI System Deployment Tests, you need to set up the test client machine.  Install PI AF Client 2018 SP3 or greater on the client machine where tests will be executed. Also, make sure the PowerShell tools for PI System 2018 SP3 are installed. 

The test client machine must have Internet access and access to the PI System components.

If any of the tools needed to build the tests are not installed, you will need to first run the ".\Run.ps1 -p" command as an Administrator to install them.

## Set access privileges

The following is the list of permissions needed by the user running the tests against the listed products.

The user needs to have Read, Write, and Modify access to the extracted PI System Deployment Tests folder to build the tests.

The given Web API credentials will be encrypted on the first run of the Run.ps1 script. The
values must be restored to a non-encrypted state if either is changed. Only the user that 
encrypted the PIWebAPIUser and PIWebAPIPassword values can decrypt them.

### PI Vision

The user needs to be a member of the PI Vision Admins and PI Vision Utility Users Windows groups.

### PI Notifications

The user needs to be a member of the Administrators Windows group in order to verify the endpoint for the
Notifications Web Service Delivery Channel.

### PI Manual Logger

The user needs access to the SQL Server where the PIMLWindows SQL database is located.

The user needs membership to the db_denydatareader and db_denydatawriter roles for the PIMLWindows SQL database.

### PI SQL Client

The user needs Read/Write, Read/Write Data, and Delete permissions to the OSIsoft\RTQP Engine\Custom Objects element in the Configuration database on an AF Server.


## Edit the App.Config file

The *App.config* file is where you set values for your target PI System.

**Warning:** Do not edit any of the "**key**" names in the *App.config* file. Only make changes to the "**value**" entries.

1.  After unzipping the *PISystemDeploymentTests.zip* file, navigate to the  _PISystemDeploymentTests\source_ directory.
2. Open the *App.config* file and then make changes as defined above to all the PI System components on your target PI System.

   ![screen_AppConfig](./images/screen_AppConfig.png)

    **Note:** Some values are required. At a minimum, you must fill in the values of PIDataArchive, AFServer, AF Database, and PIAnalysisService.

3.  Save your changes.
