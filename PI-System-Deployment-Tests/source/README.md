# What tests run?

```
Warning: PI System Deployment Tests should not be run on a production environment.
```

The PI System Deployment Tests PowerShell script runs Preliminary Checks first and then a suite of tests:

1.  Preliminary Checks: Check that the minimum items are in place for the components you are testing before running the test suite.  For example, it checks that PI Data Archive services are running and performs connectivity checks. The PowerShell script will not run the suite of tests until all the Preliminary Checks pass.

2.  Suite of tests: These tests run after the Preliminary Checks pass. These tests run serially; no tests run in parallel.  See the table below for a full list of tests.
