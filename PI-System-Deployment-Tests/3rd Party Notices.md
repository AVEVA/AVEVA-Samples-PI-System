(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.VersionCheckAnalyzer 2.9.3, Microsoft.CodeQuality.Analyzers 2.9.3, Microsoft.NetCore.Analyzers 2.9.3, Microsoft.NetFramework.Analyzers 2.9.3)

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY, (Updated 04-2019)

These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on
where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named
above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the
software, except to the extent those have different terms.

IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

  1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
    You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design,
    develop and test youre applications. You may modify, copy, distribute or
    deploy any .js files contained in the software as part of your applications.

  2. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with
    separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described
    in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.

  3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.

      a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE. In addition to the .js files described above, the
        software is comprised of Distributable Code. "Distributable Code" is code
        that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you
        comply with the terms below.


        i. Right to Use and Distribute.

          * You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.

          * Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
            programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of
            those programs.

        ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute,
          you must

          * use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone
            distribution;

          * require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
            protect it at least as much as this agreement;

          * display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and

          * indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
            including attorneys fees, related to the distribution or use of your
            applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on
            the Distributable Code.

        iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not

          * alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable
            Code;

          * use Microsofts trademarks in your programs names or in a way that
            suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;

          * include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful
            programs; or

          * modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
            that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An
            Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
            modification or distribution, that

          * the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

          * others have the right to modify it.

  4. DATA.

    a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your
      use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
      information to provide services and improve our products and services. You
      may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the
      product documentation. There are also some features in the software that
      may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your
      applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable
      law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications
      together with a copy of Microsofts privacy statement. Our privacy statement
      is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn
      more about data collection and use in the help documentation and our
      privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to
      these practices.

    b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
      subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft
      makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection
      Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective
      May 25, 2018, at http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9840733.

  5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
    gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
    rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
    you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In
    doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that
    only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

      * work around any technical limitations in the software;

      * reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
        attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
        extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
        open source components that may be included in the software;

      * remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
        suppliers in the software;

      * use the software in any way that is against the law; or

      * share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a
        stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
        agreement to any third party.

  6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
    export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
    restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information
    on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.

  7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide
    support services for it.

  8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
    Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
    agreement for the software and support services.

  9. APPLICABLE LAW. If you acquired the software in the United States,
    Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
    agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
    claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

  10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain
    legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
    laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with
    Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
    acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if
    the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if
    you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country
    law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:

      a. Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
        Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

      b. Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
        updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your
        device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet,
        however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates),
        or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also
        specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.

      c. Germany and Austria.

          i. Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in
            any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives
            no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

          ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
            negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in
            case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
            according to the statutory law.


        Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for
        slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual
        obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of
        this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this
        agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
        (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
        Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence

  11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK
    OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS.
    TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED
    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT.

  12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
    RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
    INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
    content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
    applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty,
    guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the
    extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
    possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply
    to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or
    limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the
clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses
dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

Elle s ’ applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la
limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus
ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard..

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
