# OSIsoft Samples

([OSIsoft](https://www.osisoft.com/)) is a proven leader in enabling operation intelligence. In this GitHub repo, we provide samples which will help you get started with using the OSIsoft PI System. The samples are intended to help you get started and are not production applications and libraries.

The OSIsoft PI System samples are organized by tasks and accessible through the following table:
